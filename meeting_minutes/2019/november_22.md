# November 22, 2019

Attendees: Ich, Laurent, Tim, Sylvain, Sam, Nestor, Yaolong, Jacob, Suzuka, Finn

Finn and Nestor will help with Sam's OMR work, and they will help with the third and fourth movement, respectively. The deadline is Dec. 6th.

Yaolong will commit his corrected results today (already committed).

We decide to get rid of all the dynamics expressions, because:
(1) They contain most errors from the OMR software.
(2) Dynamics can easily be attributed to editors.

We also need to justify why we comply with our current OMR correction protocol (suggested by Ich).

Plan for next week:
(1) Nestor and Yaolong will run automatic key-finding and chord labeling on both Op. 81 Fugue and Op 44.1 Movement 2, and we will take a look at the results, discussing some annotating protocols, and plans for cross-checking.
(2) Jacob will do the assignment for cross-checking, so everybody knows what to double-check.
(3) We will also try to make a timeline for the whole project, outlining the necessary steps and job assignments for everyone.
