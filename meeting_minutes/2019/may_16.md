Discussion about the dataset group project.

Are we going in the direction of String Quartets or Piano Sonatas?

It seems String Quartets
Due to the availability of data, the best would be to choose a classical composer.

Options:
Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schubert

Mendelssohn it is!

How to annotate?

American annotation system seems better for this cause because it is more verbose
We haven't decided exactly on what things we are annotating and how we are annotating them, but in principle, something like the ABC Corpus is a good reference

Task for this week: Let's find the available scores (paper and symbolic) of the Mendelssohn String Quartets.
